Build a classic Hangman game in Python. Practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection by creating a word-guessing game where players try to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create the Hangman Game

#### Description
Write a Python program that lets a player guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game should track the number of incorrect guesses and end when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses from the user
- Display the current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _ a _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Show a win or lose message at the end

Example:
```text
Word: _ _ n _ m _ n
Guess a letter: a
Incorrect guesses left: 5
Word: _ a n _ m a n
...etc...
```

### 🛠️	Add Extra Features (Optional)

#### Description
Enhance your Hangman game with additional features to make it more fun or challenging.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Show previously guessed letters
- Allow the player to choose difficulty (number of attempts)
- Use a larger or themed word list
- Add ASCII art for the hangman
